## About

This is a template repository for running Wordpress within a Docker environment. With the approach that it is easy to set up and you can run many wordpress environments on a single host.

## Get started

How to start with this Laravel Docker template:

```

3. Inside the `.env` file give the following variables a value
    - `APP_NAME`
    - `APP_PORT`
    - `MYSQL_HOST`
    - `MYSQL_PORT`
    - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`
    - `MYSQL_USERNAME`
    - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

### Ports (optional)

By default port **8000** is set for Wordpress and **3306** for MySQL, if you prefer to use other ports you can change this in the created `.env` file.

### Volumes (optional)

If you want to access the persistent data from the containers, you just have to uncomment the volumes in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.
